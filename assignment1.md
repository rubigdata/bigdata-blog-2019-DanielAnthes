# Assignment 1 

## Creating a Blog Post

### Markdown

This entry to the blog was created with Markdown. Markdown can be used for
simple styling of documents.

Add lists by starting a line with '- ':

- like 
- this

Add enumerations by starting a line with '1. 2. ...':

1. like
2. that

Links are added using `[linktext](link)`

[like this](assignment1.md)

### Publishing the Blog

The new blog pages are published by pushing them to the github repository for
the blog. Each assignment gets its own file and added with a link to index.md, which is
automatically loaded when the site is first accessed [here](https://rubigdata.github.io/bigdata-blog-2019-DanielAnthes)
